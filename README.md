# Road Accidents in France (2019–2023)  
**Data Analysis · Google Colab · Power BI Dashboard**

This project analyzes **over 270,000 road accidents** in France involving more than **600,000 people** between 2019 and 2023.  
The focus is on identifying **which factors most influence injury severity** — for example, user profile, location, or speed limit.

The overall goal was to combine **statistical analysis** with an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to generate meaningful insights that can support long-term **road-safety improvements**.
