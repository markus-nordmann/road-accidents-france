We then concatenated the yearly files into one DataFrame per table (This can be seen and discussed further below for each table).\n","\n","Doing this will enable us to work with a cleaner and more consistent dataset. First because the reporting formats have been more stable in recent years, but also focusing on 2019–2023 makes it easier to detect and handle any data inconsistencies on a year-by-year basis. At the same time, we still benefit from a dataset that is large enough (for example, more than 200,000 rows for df_places alone) to identify meaningful trends and produce insightful visualizations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"g5kHEmKgrAAc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761292247096,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":95,"user":{"displayName":"Markus Nordmann","userId":"09968284156967159020"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":457},"outputId":"677061a9-bcac-4905-ec9a-2fb387ec1532"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["           ds                holiday\n","0  2005-01-01               New year\n","1  2005-03-28          Easter Monday\n","2  2005-05-01             Labour Day\n","3  2005-05-05     Ascension Thursday\n","4  2005-05-08  Victory in Europe Day"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-ed072f94-f81a-47fa-82e2-1de3c5aae641\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>ds</th>\n","      <th>holiday</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2005-01-01</td>\n","      <td>New year</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2005-03-28</td>\n","      <td>Easter Monday</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2005-05-01</td>\n","      <td>Labour Day</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>2005-05-05</td>\n","      <td>Ascension Thursday</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>2005-05-08</td>\n","      <td>Victory in Europe Day</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-ed072f94-f81a-47fa-82e2-1de3c5aae641')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-ed072f94-f81a-47fa-82e2-1de3c5aae641 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
