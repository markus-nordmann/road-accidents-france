This makes the workflow more modular and easier to maintain.  \n","\n","We first download the prepared merge file (covering the years 2019–2023) from Google Drive using `gdown`. Afterwards, we load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. While importing, we explicitly define some columns (`nbv`, `pr`, `lartpc`, `larrout`, `id_usager`) as strings, since they contained mixed data types across different years. This ensures consistency and avoids parsing errors later during analysis.  \n","\n","Next, we clean and reformat specific columns:  \n","- **`id_vehicule`**: Converted from string to `int64` after removing spaces (`\" \"`) and non-breaking spaces (`\"\\xa0\"`). This step ensures all vehicle IDs are treated as integers instead of mixed types.  \n","- **Categorical columns (`grav`, `catu`, `sexe`, `trajet`, `secu1`, `secu2`, `secu3`)**: Originally stored as `float64`, these columns contained missing values. To avoid issues, missing values were replaced with `-1` (representing *not specified*) and the columns were cast to `int64`.  \n","\n","This preprocessing step results in a more consistent dataset where identifiers are properly formatted, and categorical variables no longer contain floats or missing values.  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"RC2MSAUwqerO"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eR_v67CyUjXB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761290629387,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":12732,"user":{"displayName":"Markus Nordmann","userId":"09968284156967159020"}},"outputId":"8913aca4-6c40-4606-9869-d7f93f0c85dc"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: gdown in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (5.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from gdown) (4.13.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from gdown) (3.20.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests[socks] in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from gdown) (2.32.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from gdown) (4.67.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from beautifulsoup4->gdown) (2.8)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=4.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from beautifulsoup4->gdown) (4.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset_normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from requests[socks]->gdown) (3.4.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from requests[socks]->gdown) (3.11)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from requests[socks]->gdown) (2.5.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from requests[socks]->gdown) (2025.10.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: PySocks!=1.5.7,>=1.5.6 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from requests[socks]->gdown) (1.7.1)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install -U gdown"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import gdown\n","\n","# ~~~ FILE LOCATIONS ~~~\n","\n","file_id = '193qtxJgZKQt7QRLqKLQlZUxWOsomgnVA'             #
